#Rectangle Party

Welcome to Rectangle Party, an app that lets you create rectangles.  There are two ways to create rectangles: either by clicking the button to add a random rectangle to the page or by clicking in the white space itself. One click will create a small rectangle.  Click and drag will create a rectangle of different proportions.  Watch out if your rectablges get too close!

To run the app, load the index.html page in your browser or you can also visit https://rectangle-party.firebaseapp.com.

The source code is contained within the index.html page as well as on github at https://github.com/lmcardle/rectangleParty.
